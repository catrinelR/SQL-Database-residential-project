Description: \
In order to manage the activity, a private real estate developer wants to create a database that can be used within a larger computer application. \
The designed database includes real estate records within a private residential project – the complete offer of houses and apartments in the managed ensemble, data about buyers who purchase the properties and data about the actual sales of the real estate. \
Thus, the business entities that need to store information about them are: their properties and type, customers – general and private data and sales. \
Project requirements: 
- identification of business entities that require the storage of information about them 
- establishment of the relations between the entities mentioned above 
- creation of the entity-relationship diagram  
- establishing the scheme of each entity, its attributes and the domains of the attributes (establishing the data types for each attribute) 
- setting possible additional restrictions (unique keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL) 
- database creation in RDBMS (relational database management system) MySQL 
- effective creation of tables in the database, for each entity, respecting the type of date previously established for each attribute  
- creation of relations between tables (FOREIGN KEY) 
- inserting a reasonable number of records to demonstrate the use of the database 
- demonstrating how to use data by creating scripts (SQL instructions) that provide the following results: 
  * list of marketable products (example: list of properties); 
  * client list; 
  * list of orders registered in the system; 
  * list of orders received from customers, along with data of their respective customers (example: list of sales and name and address of buyers); 
  * last order launched by a particular customer; 
  * 3 data aggregations for statistical purposes (GROUP BY) involving at least one link between the data tables (example how many properties of each type were sold, for example, how much money has each customer spent or the list of customers who have bought at least twice); 
  * offering at least for one of the above scripts an alternative writing: sub-query based, with JOIN, with views, etc.
